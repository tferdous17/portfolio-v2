            Hello! My name is Tasnim and I enjoy building complex systems and
            engaging digital experiences. My interest in software development
            started roughly 3 years ago and since then, I've been constantly
            learning, experimenting, and rebuilding software across various
            domainsâ€”from distributed systems to fullstack applications. My primary
            focus is distributed systems and backend development,
            but I also enjoy creating websites that can leave a tangible impact.
          </p>

            On campus, I founded the Artificial Intelligence Club @ FSC where
            I, along with my fellow officers, have built an active community of
            70+ members for those with a shared interest in A.I. I've also been
            a key organizer, mentor and judge for <a href="https://www.ramhacks.com/" target="_blank" className="text-blue-400 underline">RamHacks</a>, a new hackathon that
            was able to get 80 participants and secure nearly $1,000 in prizes
            its first time around. Not too bad!

            When I'm not coding, you can find me going on long-distance runs,
            playing video games, traveling, or learning a new skill for fun!
